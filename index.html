					<h1>The Gift</h1>
					<hr />
					<p>A few weeks ago, while shopping for Halloween decorations at our favorite antique store, Anna found the mirror of her dreams!  It's a 19th century reproduction of an 18th century Rococo floor mirror.  Its in very good shape and stands over 7 feet tall.</p>

							Unfortunatly, the most we could talk the owner down to was <b>$600.00</b>.  I suggested to Anna that we try and croud source the cost of the mirror as a present for her birthday.
							I created this page to reach out to all of her friends and family and see if anyone wanted to contribute to
							this awesome birthday present.  So, if you want to contribute, simply 
							<button type="submit" class="btn btn-link" style="padding:0;"> make a donation </button>
							through Pay Pal <u><b>for any amount</b></u>.  If you want to include
							a picture or message, <a href="mailto:mrh@wildcardlogic.com?subject=Anna's Birthday Present">email me</a>
							the message and the picture, and I will be sure to put it on this page.

					<h1>F.A.Q.</h1>
					<hr />
					<p>
						<b>What if I want my contribution to not be listed on this webpage?</b><br />
						Simply let me know and I will only include your name on the gift card.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>How will Anna know I contributed?</b><br/>
						In addition to this page, we will also be presenting Anna with a card that will include a list of all the contributors.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Is there a time limit?</b><br />
						We will be presenting the mirror to Anna on her birthday - so that's the deadline.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Have you already aquired the mirror?</b><br />
						In order to ensure the mirror was still availiable, we purchaced the mirror two weeks ago and are storing it for Anna's birthday.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>What happends if you dont reach your goal?</b><br />
						We already purchaced the mirror for Anna.  If we don't reach our goal, I will just cover the additional cost.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Is this gift a secret?</b><br />
						No.  As we live in a small appartment it is difficult to keep something like this a secret.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>How will you present the mirror?</b><br />
						We plan on installing the mirror in Anna's room on her birthday (Nov 24th) with a big bow and a card that lists all the contributors.  We will be sure to take a ton of pictures and post them on this page after we present the gift.  I will be sure to send out an email to all the contributors so they know the update has happened.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Can I share this page with other people?  Can anyone contribute?</b><br />
						Yes, please.  The more people who contribute, the better.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>What will you do if you get more money than you need for the mirror?</b><br />
						We will present Anna with a gift card to use at the antique store to make additional purchaces.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Is this website secure?</b><br />
						As there is no personal information included here, this website does not need to be secured.  However, all donations through PayPal are fully protected by PayPal's security.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>What if I want to do something else? Send a card?  Additional gift?</b><br />
						Feel free to do so in anyway you want!  I am sure Anna will be grateful for any and all gifts she recieves.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>What if I don't have PayPal?  Or don't want to use PayPal?</b><br />
						Feel free to <a href="mailto:mrh@wildcardlogic.com?subject=Anna's Birthday Present">contact me</a> and we can make other arrangments.
